Satisfactory DedicatedServer one-click start (and guard server) code version 1.0
There is a minor bug

Put the Satisfactory DedicatedServer folder in the C drive directory
First start the game download update file.bat
After the update is completed, there will be an additional GameServers folder in the folder
Finally start the one-click start server code.bat
That's it

Game server update, please manually close all CMD pop-ups
